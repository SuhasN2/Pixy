I have initialized virtual environment before initialized git

so I ended up tracking get environment file ".venv"

now I stop tracking that and also made some minor improvements

did some testing to determine the potential misuse of AI

From now I will take this project seriously and will not have commit messages. saying I hate my life

If a hiring person is going through this I will promise I won't do this in a production environment. lot of the times I was working on this good late night. So the commit messages and the code quality. aren't the best and from now I will try to keep it. As good as I can.
